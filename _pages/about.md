My background and history:
======
Growing up in a cross-cultural milieu, I navigated my early education in China, embracing its traditional values and solid education system from pre-k to Grade 8. In 2015, my journey took a significant turn when I moved to the United States as a foreign exchange student, starting grade 9 at Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy in Utah, and later completing my last two years of high school education at Saint Bernard School in Connecticut. This transition was marked by my adaptation to living with a Latter-day Saints host family in Utah, where I faced the intricate challenge of mastering English, an experience that sparked my deep interest in bilingualism. My academic path led me to the University of Washington for undergraduate studies, where I majored in Creative Writing and Early Childhood Education, immersing myself in literacy development and educational theories. Furthering my education, I pursued my Master's at UCLA. Throughout this journey, my role as an online math tutor during the pandemic, especially teaching bilingual students, greatly enhanced my understanding of bilingual pedagogy and the diverse educational needs of students with different language proficiencies.
