Hey there! My name is Le Rosie Xiu. I am a Ph.D. student with a concertration in Educational Psychology at the University of Southern California (USC) Rossier School of Education. I serve as a research assistant at the Center for Generative AI & Society and is advised by [Dr. Stephen Aguilar](https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty-research/directory/stephenaguilar). My research interests are AI Literacy Development, GenAI & EdTech in Education, Bilingual Learners(BLLs), Learning Analytics, Digital Equity. 

I obatined my Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree at University of Washington in Creative Writing and Education. Following my undergraduate degree, I pursued the Master of Arts (M.A.) in Human Development and Psychology in [UCLA Language and Literacy Research Group](https://langlit.gseis.ucla.edu/), advised by [Prof. Alison Bailey](https://seis.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/alison-bailey) from [UCLA’s Human Development and Psychology Department](https://seis.ucla.edu/departments-and-degrees/department-of-education/human-development-and-psychology-division).

Positionality Statement
======
Growing up in a cross-cultural milieu, I navigated my early education in China, embracing its traditional values and education system from Pre-K to Grade 8. In 2015, I transitioned to the U.S. educational system, where I’ve spent nearly ten years immersed in its complexities. My journey began as a foreign exchange student in Utah’s public school system, which was funded by the U.S. government. I later completed my high school education at a Catholic private school in Connecticut.

This shift between these educational environments—Chinese, public American, and private American—was more than a simple change of location; it was an exploration of cultural and ideological differences. In Shenzhen, China, which is a homogeneous country, education was deeply structured and collective-focused, with academic scores serving as the primary indicator of student success. These scores not only measured individual achievement but also determined a student’s place within the group. Despite the competitive nature of the system, I benefited greatly from the rigorous, foundational teaching style and the emphasis on logical reasoning and problem-solving.

When I moved to the United States in 2015, I encountered a different educational philosophy. My experience as a foreign exchange student in Utah’s public school system introduced me to a more individualistic, exploratory learning environment, where students were encouraged to question, debate, and express their opinions freely. Success in this system was measured through creativity, participation, and self-advocacy, not just standardized test scores. The challenge of balancing these two cultural identities has deeply influenced my academic and research philosophy. On one hand, the structured, knowledge-based foundation from my Chinese education instilled in me a disciplined work ethic and a methodical approach to learning. On the other, my U.S. education fostered a sense of curiosity and openness to diverse perspectives.

For my bachelors and master’s studies, I majored in Creative Writing, Education and Psychology. This academic foundation provided me with a deep understanding and creativity in literacy development, educational theories, particularly how learning frameworks shape cognitive growth. As I considered the relationship between research and practice, the position as the teacher or the learner, I began to engage more closely with students as an educator, recognizing the importance of bridging theoretical knowledge with real-world application.

Over the past three years, I gained valuable experience as an online math teacher during the pandemic. And, due to my past experiences in learning in two languages throughout my educational journey, I was able to work extensively with bilingual Mandarin-English speaking students in California. This hands-on experience with students revealed a potential divergence between my research interests and the immediate needs of my participants. While teaching online, I witnessed firsthand how educational technology—through our self-invented teaching platform—can enhance student engagement. Later, in 2021 to 2022, I observed how Generative AI can empower teachers to deliver more dynamic and personalized curricula. While my research centers around the use of Generative AI to enhance education in various ways (for instance, ‘pedagogical enhancement’, ‘specialized training and practices’, ‘writing assistance and productivity’, ‘professional skills and development’, an ‘interdisciplinary learning tool’) , my students often face more practical challenges—such as navigating language barriers, managing access to technology, and coping with the isolation of virtual learning. These experiences have underscored the importance of ensuring that my research not only advances the field of Generative AI but also addresses the tangible, day-to-day realities that students face. More broadly, this highlights the critical issue of digital equity, which remains a central concern in creating inclusive educational environments.

As a PhD student at USC, my research on EdTech and Generative AI’s role in educational transformation should be deeply intertwined with the contextual nature of race, racism, and culture. In both the specific communities I study and the broader educational landscape, race and culture play critical roles in shaping access to technology, student experiences, and educational outcomes. Generative AI has the potential to bridge gaps in education by personalizing learning experiences, but it must be implemented in ways that consider the racial and cultural realities of students. For instance, AI tools can help address language barriers by providing multilingual support, yet they can also exacerbate inequalities if they are trained without the attention to the specific needs of diverse student populations(considering the inputs). 

Also, If the ethical issues surrounding the use of Generative AI in education are not properly addressed, the differences in students’ learning motivation could exacerbate the existing gaps between students from diverse racial, socioeconomic, cultural, or ethnic backgrounds. I am mindful of the risks: if not applied thoughtfully, AI could reinforce the very disparities it seeks to solve. Thus, my research should be guided by a commitment to digital equity, ensuring that the researches I study and develop help create more inclusive and adaptive learning environments.
